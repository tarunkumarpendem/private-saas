# Private-SaaS:
---------------

* SaaS - Software as a Software
* Private SaaS is a cloud-based software delivery model that provides all the benefits of traditional SaaS, with one key difference, the software runs on a private or dedicated cloud infrastructure rather than a shared public one.

--------------------------
Build your SaaS application using Azure-compatible technologies. This might include using Azure Functions, Azure Web Apps, or deploying containers with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

* Security Considerations:
---------------------------
Implement Azure Active Directory for user authentication and access control. Utilize Azure Key Vault for securely storing sensitive information such as connection strings and API keys. Implement Azure Security Center for continuous security monitoring.

* Data Storage:
---------------
Choose appropriate Azure services for data storage. Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, or Azure Storage are common choices. Ensure that data at rest and in transit is encrypted.

* Networking:
-------------
Configure Azure Virtual Network to isolate your SaaS solution and control traffic flow. Use Network Security Groups (NSGs) to define rules for inbound and outbound traffic.

* Integration:
--------------
If your organization uses other Azure services or external systems, set up appropriate integrations. Azure Logic Apps or Azure Service Bus can facilitate communication between different components.

* Monitoring and Logging:
-------------------------
Implement Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics for monitoring your application's performance, health, and usage. Set up alerts for critical events.

* Deployment:
-------------
Deploy your application to Azure. This can be done through continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or other CI/CD tools.

* Scale and Load Balancing:
---------------------------
Configure auto-scaling for your application to handle varying workloads. Use Azure Load Balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances.

* Testing:
----------
Conduct thorough testing, including functional testing, performance testing, and security testing, to ensure the reliability of your private SaaS.

* Cost Management:
------------------
Monitor and manage costs effectively by leveraging Azure Cost Management tools. Optimize resource utilization and choose cost-effective Azure services based on your application's needs.

* Backup and Disaster Recovery:
--------------------------------
Implement backup and disaster recovery plans using Azure Backup and Azure Site Recovery to protect your data and ensure business continuity.



* For creating the private cloud in Azure 1st we need to set up Azure VMware Solution in a separate Azure subscription this will cost around $20k per month and varies based on the paln we select

* Then we need to access the private cloud (VMware Solution) for that we need to configure the VMware solution.
[Access an Azure VMware Solution private cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-vmware/tutorial-access-private-cloud)

* Azure VMware Solution doesn't allow us to manage your private cloud with your on-premises vCenter Server. Instead, we need to connect to the Azure VMware Solution vCenter Server instance through a jump box.
* Then we need to connect the vCenter Server of your private cloud
![preview](./Images/Private-SaaS-4.png)

* Then we need to Configure networking for our VMware private cloud in Azure
[Configure networking for VMware private cloud in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-vmware/tutorial-configure-networking)
* Then we need to connect to the private cloud manually and do the necessary configurations.

* Then we need to Add an NSX-T Data Center network segment in Azure VMware Solution.

* After deploying Azure VMware Solution, you can configure an NSX-T Data Center network segment from NSX-T Manager or the Azure portal. Once configured, the segments are visible in Azure VMware Solution, NSX-T Manager, and vCenter Server. NSX-T Data Center comes pre-provisioned by default with an NSX-T Data Center Tier-0 gateway in Active/Active mode and a default NSX-T Data Center Tier-1 gateway in Active/Standby mode. These gateways let you connect the segments (logical switches) and provide East-West and North-South connectivity.

* Now, we are trying to set up the priavte environment by creating a new subscription in Azure and provisioning the infra under a new vNet under the newly created subscription.
